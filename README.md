# A-Little-Adventure
A Little Adventure is a 3D, third-person puzzle/adventure game inspired by The Secret World of Arrietty (Yonebayashi, 2011), a Studio Ghibli film based on the book The Borrowers by Mary Norton. The game will have the player play as three different characters, each with their own different strengths and abilities which can be used in combination to overcome obstacles.

I hope to continue working on the prototype to tighten up the mechanics, add more gameplay and improve environment/character models. All feedback is welcome!
